# WordPress Best Practices for PHP, JavaScript, and CSS Development

## Source Files
- **Location:** All source files for this plugin are located in the `kealoa-reference` directory. This includes PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files.
- **Structure:** The source files are organized into different subdirectories based on their type (e.g., `php`, `js`, `css`) to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
- **WordPress:** The plugin is designed to be used within the WordPress ecosystem, following WordPress coding standards and best practices.

## PHP Best Practices
- **Use Proper Naming Conventions:** Follow PSR standards and use descriptive function and variable names.
- **Sanitize Input:** Always sanitize input data using functions like `sanitize_text_field()` before saving it to the database.
- **Use Nonces:** Use nonces to protect against CSRF attacks when handling form submissions.
- **Avoid Global Variables:** Limit the use of global variables to keep the code organized and maintainable.
- **Follow Template Hierarchy:** Leverage WordPress's template hierarchy to ensure consistent design and functionality.

## JavaScript Best Practices
- **Use `wp_enqueue_script`:** Always enqueue scripts using `wp_enqueue_script()` to prevent conflicts and ensure proper loading.
- **Follow the JavaScript Coding Standards:** Use modern JavaScript features (ES6) and enforce coding standards using tools like ESLint.
- **Avoid Inline JavaScript:** Keep JavaScript out of your HTML files; instead, use external files and let WordPress handle them.
- **Use AJAX Properly:** When using AJAX, ensure you use the admin-ajax.php endpoint correctly and properly handle security checks.

## CSS Best Practices
- **Follow the BEM Methodology:** Use Block Element Modifier (BEM) for CSS class naming to increase readability and maintainability.
- **Use SASS/SCSS:** Utilize preprocessors like SASS/SCSS for better organization of styles and variables.
- **Optimize CSS:** Minimize and combine CSS where possible to reduce load times, using tools like Autoprefixer.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure all styles are responsive and utilize media queries effectively.

## Configuration Management
- **Update plugin patch number after each change:** Do not update the major and minor version numbers unless explicitly told to do so.

## Conclusion
By following these best practices, you ensure that your WordPress development is secure, maintainable, and performative. Adhering to these guidelines will help you write better code and create a better user experience for your site’s visitors.
